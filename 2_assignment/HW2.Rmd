## 1. Introduction

The setup of this game is as follows. Here are our players: 

* $A$ - Antwohnette
* $B$ - BadellPadel
* $C$ - Chumbawamba 

We know that:

* $\nu(\emptyset)=0$
* $\nu(A)=\nu(B)=\nu(C)=0$
* $\nu(AB)=2 \hspace{.5cm} \nu(BC)=2 \hspace{.5cm} \nu(AC)=0$
* $\nu(ABC)=4$


The marginal contribution of each player $j$ in a game $G(\pi, \nu)$, $\pi$ being
the current permutation considered and $\nu$ the characteristic function, and $S_{\pi}(j)$ the contribution of 
the predecessors of $j$ in the permutation $\pi$, is defined as: 
$$ \Delta_{\pi}^{G}(j) = \nu(S_{\pi}(j) \cup \{j\}) - \nu(S_{\pi}(j))$$

We will now have to tackle calculate the various payoffs in each permutation of $A,B,C$. Let us start:
$$\\[.5cm]$$

<table>
<tr>
<td>
* **ABC**
  - $\nu(A) = \nu(\emptyset \cup A) - \nu(\emptyset) = 0$
  - $\nu(B) = \nu(A \cup B) - \nu(A) = 2$
  - $\nu(C) = \nu(AB \cup C) - \nu(AB) = 2$
</td>
<td>
* **ACB**
  - $\nu(A) = 0$
  - $\nu(C) = \nu(A \cup C) - \nu(A) = 0$
  - $\nu(B) = \nu(AC \cup B) - \nu(AC) = 4$
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
* **BAC**
  - $\nu(B) = 0$
  - $\nu(A) = \nu(AB) - \nu(B) = 2$
  - $\nu(C) = \nu(AB \cup C) - \nu(AB) = 2$
</td>
<td>
* **BCA**
  - $\nu(B) = 0$
  - $\nu(C) = \nu(C \cup B) - \nu(B) = 2$
  - $\nu(A) = \nu(BC \cup A) - \nu(BC) = 2$
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
* **CAB**
  - $\nu(C) = 0$
  - $\nu(A) = \nu(A \cup C) - \nu(C) = 0$
  - $\nu(B) = \nu(AC \cup B) - \nu(AC) = 4$
</td>
<td>
* **CBA**
  - $\nu(C) = 0$
  - $\nu(B) = \nu(B \cup C) - \nu(C) = 2$
  - $\nu(A) = \nu(BC \cup A) - \nu(BC) = 2$
</td>
</tr>

</table>

$$\\[1cm]$$

Finally, we can put everything in this more readable table:


<div style = "margin-left:30%; margin-right:30%;">
| Permutation | $\nu(A)$ | $\nu(B)$ | $\nu(C)$|
| ----------: | :------: | :------: | :------:|
|     ABC     |    0     |    2     |     2   |
|     ACB     |    0     |    4     |     0   |
|     BAC     |    2     |    0     |     2   |
|     BCA     |    2     |    0     |     2   |
|     CAB     |    0     |    4     |     0   |
|     CBA     |    2     |    2     |     0   |
|  **Total**  |  **6**   |  **12**  |  **6**  |
</div>



Now we can calculate $\psi(j)$: 

$$\psi^G(j) =  \frac{1}{p!} \cdot \sum_{\pi \in \Pi_P} \Delta_{\pi}^{G}(j)$$
Using the definition above: 

* $\psi(A) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot (\Delta_{\text{ABC}}(\text{A}) + \Delta_{\text{ACB}}(\text{A}) + ...) = 1$
* $\psi(B) = 2$
* $\psi(C) = 1$

$$\psi(A) + \psi(B) + \psi(C) = \nu(ABC) = 4$$

So the efficiency is respected, as their sum is 4 and equal to $\nu(ABC)$.

## 2. Probabilistic

We have wanted to to approximate the Shapley payoffs of player 2, because he is the member that works more, 7 hours per day, player 12, because he is one of the member that works less, 3 hours per day, and player 6, because he is in the middle between them with 5 hours per day. 

We have written the function *value* that return an approximation of the Shapley payoff taking in input an integer number that represents the player, the tolerance and confidence for the Hoeffding confidence intervals. 

Firstly the function has to compute the simulation size M, to do it we have computed the upper bound *b* for the characteristic function. From the introductory part we have realized that the characteristic function for a variable is maximum when it is located at the end of the permutation and *b* varies among different members. On the other hand it takes its minimum value when player is located at the start of the permutation and *a* is equal to zero for each member. 

Through the function *sample* we are able to pick different permutations of the team members and for each of them we compute the marginal contribution of the chosen player with respect to that permutation. (We identify the position in the permutation of our player, truncated the permutation at his position, compute the characteristic function of coalitions with and without our player and make the difference between them.) If the chosen player is in the first place of the permutation his marginal contribution is zero. Eventually we take the mean of all marginal contribution computed in each simulation, that is our approximation of the Shapley payoff for the chosen player.

```{r}
load("./char_fun.RData")
value <- function(team_member, eps, alpha){
  #input:
  #team_member: an integer that represent the player that we want to study
  #eps: tolerance
  #alpha: confidence
  
  #output:
  #Shapley payoff of the player
  
  #string with all the team members
  member <- "1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12"
  
  #this line is useful to delete the given team member from the "member" string
  team_member_1 <- paste("-", as.character(team_member), sep = "")
  
  #compute the max value that the given team member can assume 
  b <- char_fun[[12]] - char_fun[[11]][str_remove(member, team_member_1)]
  #b = 20 
  
  #compute the min value that the given team member can assume
  a <- char_fun[[1]][team_member]
  
  #Through Hoeffding compute the number of iteration 
  M <- ceiling(((b-a)^2/(2*eps^2)) * log(2/alpha))

  x <- seq(1,12)
  
  #putting a seed
  set.seed(1234)

  value_of_person <- c(length(M))
  for (i in 1:M){
    
    #sample
    campione <- sample(x)
    
    #discover the position of my person
    position <- which(campione == team_member) 
    
    #sort element until my person
    element <- sort(campione[1:position])
    
    #write in the same format of char_fun
    element_1<- paste(element, collapse = "-")
    
    #compute the value with my person
    v_1 <- char_fun[[position]][element_1] 
    
    #consider separately if the member is in the first position
    if(v_1 == 0){
      
      #so its values is zero
      value_of_person[i] <- 0
      
    }else{
      
      #delete my person from the sequence
      element_2 <- sort(element[element != team_member])
      
      #write in the same format of char_fun
      element_3 <- paste(element_2, collapse = "-")
      
      #compute the value without my person
      v_2 <- char_fun[[position-1]][element_3]
      
      #compute the value of my person 
      value_of_person[i] <- v_1 - v_2
    }
  }
  
  #take the mean of my person 
  return(mean(value_of_person))
  
}
```

We have tried to run our function with rougher value of b, but the only difference is that M increased (the approximation remained the same), so we think that is correct that the characteristic function of a player is maximum when he is located at the end of the sequence. 
According Hoeffding (1- $\alpha$) confidence set we have:
$M_{\epsilon}^* \ge \frac{(b-a)^2 \cdot log(\frac{2}{\alpha^2})}{2 \cdot \epsilon^2}$

M is the smallest simulation size that allows to control deviation between the approximation and the true value of the Shapley payoff at a probability level equals to confidence. 
We have chosen different tolerances and confidences for three players in such way that for each of them we have almost the same smallest simulation size, circa 330,000. 
In this way the computational time is not too high, circa 30s for each simulation and at the same time we have very small values for $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$: confidence $1-\alpha$ is around 0.99 while the tolerance $\epsilon$ varies between 0.009 and 0.02. 

Our procedure to approximate the true value of the Shapley payoff, traps the true value in an interval ($\theta-\epsilon$, $\theta+\epsilon$) with probability $1 -\alpha$ that is in every simulation a bit greater than 0.99, while the size of intervals is really small, $2 \cdot \epsilon$.

For player 2 *b* is higher (7) than for player 12 (3), so for his simulation we have chosen higher tolerance and $\alpha$, to try to have similar M. While for player 6 and 12 we have the same simulation size M and confidence(1 - $\alpha$), but different values of tolerances. 

```{r}
epsilon <- c(0.02,0.015,0.009)
confidence <- c(1-0.009, 1-0.005, 1-0.005)
run_time <- c(length = 3)
#starting time
t1 <- Sys.time()

#player 2
player_2 <- value(2, epsilon[1], confidence[1])  #M = 330976

#run time
run_time[1] <- Sys.time() - t1 

#starting time
t1 <- Sys.time()

#player 6
player_6 <-value(6, epsilon[2], confidence[2])  #M = 332860

#run time
run_time[2] <- Sys.time() - t1 

#starting time
t1 <- Sys.time()

#player 12
player_12 <- value(12, epsilon[3], confidence[3]) #M = 332860

#run time
run_time[3] <- Sys.time() - t1 

```

We  have rescaled the payoffs that we have obtained: we have divided the results of our simulations for 45, the values of coalition includes all the player so in this way $\nu(P) = 1$. We have done it to make this game **simple**, indeed it is monotone and rescaling the characteristic function it can take values only between 0 and 1. In simple games Shapley payoff measures the *power of a player*: the probability that he can influence the outcome of the game. 
This confirms the intuition that player 2 is the one more influential because he works more than other so he can allow to save more hours than others. The opposite reasoning for player 12, that works less than any other. 
The more the player works the higher is his payoff. Indeed player 2 is the one with higher Shapley payoff, while player 12 the one with the smaller Shapley payoff, player 6 in the middle. Our results are summarized in a dataframe. 

```{r}

#rescale the shapley payoff and round their value
shapley <- c(round(player_2/45, 3),round(player_6/45, 3), round(player_12/45, 3))

#player that we have chosen 
player <- c(2,6,12)

#dataframe to visualize clearer the results. 
results <- data.frame("Player" = player,  "Shapley Payoff"=  shapley, "Tolerance" = epsilon, "Confidence" = confidence, "Run Time" = run_time)
results


```

## 2. Bonus

We have tried to write functions to get characteristic function for a general game of this type. We know from the introductory part that the value of a coalition is defined as $\nu$(C)={# of hours potentially saved by well organized coalition}. So we know that if a coalition is composed by a single person we cannot save hours, while if n players work during the same hour we save n-1 working hours. If we want to know if two or more players work at the same time we scan the schedule column by column.

Firstly we have created the *char_function_1* that receives in input the schedule of workers and a vector containing the member of coalition in which we are interested in. We have thought at the schedule of workers as a matrix M where $M_{i,j} is 1 if the i-th player works at the j-th hour, 0 otherwise. This function returns the value of the given coalition. 

```{r}

char_function_1 <- function(matrice, lista){
  
  #input:
  #matrice: it represents the schedule of workers
  #lista: coalition of which we are interested in 
  
  #output:
  #value of the given coalition 
  
  #we assume that if coalition is composed by one member
  #its value is zero
  if(length(lista) == 1){
    return(0)
  }else{
    
    #we take the the schedule of workers that belong to our coalition 
    #(for example if we have the coalition c(1,2,4) 
    #we will pick row 1,2 and 4 of the schedule
    member <- matrice[lista,]
    
    #we compare the columns of the selected rows
    #if two workers work during the same hour the sum of that column will be greater than one
    #we save (the sum of the column - 1)hours
    #we consider hours in which more players work
    vettore <- colSums(member)
    return(sum(vettore[vettore > 1] - 1))
  }
  
}

#just to have a feedback we have built the schedule of the homework
#1 if the player works during that hour, 0 otherwise
uno <- c(0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1)
due <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0)
tre <- c(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0)
quattro <- c(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1)
cinque <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0)
sei <- c(0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0)
sette <- c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0)
otto <- c(1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0)
nove <- c(0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)
dieci <- c(0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1)
undici <- c(1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0)
dodici <- c(0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1)
matrice_prova <- rbind(uno,due,tre,quattro,cinque,sei,sette,otto,nove,dieci,undici,dodici)

#few trials to check if our char_function_1 works
char_function_1(matrice_prova, c(12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)) == char_fun[[12]]
char_function_1(matrice_prova, c(2,1)) == char_fun[[2]][1]
char_function_1(matrice_prova, c(2)) == char_fun[[1]][2]

#another example, the working hours in a day are the same, 8
x <- seq(1,8)

#number of workers
n <- 20

#just build a random matrix that represents the schedule 
matrice <- sapply(x, function(x) sample(c(0,1), size = n, replace = T, prob = c(0.75,0.25)))

#compute the value for a given coalition 
char_function_1(matrice, c(3,14,18,19))
```

Then we have created *char_function* that taking in input the number of players *n* and the working schedule, still represented by a matrix of zeros and ones. This function computes the values for each possible coalition: firstly it saves all possible combinations in a list *comb* and later we compute the value for each coalition with the same reasoning as before. The final results are in the list *ris* that has a length equals to the number of possible coalition $2^n-1$ (-1 is due to that the empty set is not considered) and each element of this list has two values, the first one is the value of the coalition while the second one is a sequence of integer number corresponding to the coalition. We have done two query at the end two verify the results, we sort the query before making the search inside our list. At the end we compute all the combinations and their values for a general case where *n* = 200 and the working schedule is random. 

```{r}
char_function <- function(matrice, n){
  
  #input:
  #matrice: it represents the schedule
  #n: number of players
  
  #output:
  #ris: list containing for each coalition its value
  
  #list that will contain all the combinations, all possible coalitions 
  comb <- list()
  for (i in 1:n){
    
    #we compute all the combination, that are 2^(number of players) - 1(it does not consider empty set)
    #we use a function of library(DescTools)
    a <- CombSet(n, i, repl=FALSE, ord=FALSE)
    
    #we scan all the combinations
    for(j in 1:nrow(a)){
      
      #save the j-th combination in  a temporary variable
      temp <- list(a[j,])
      
      #we fill the list with the combinations obtained
      comb <- append(comb, temp)
    }
  }
  
  #it contains the value of each coalition 
  risultato <- c(length(comb)) 
  
  #a list of lists that contains all the coalitions and their values
  ris <- list()
  
  #scan all possible coalition
  for(i in 1:length(comb)){
    
    #if coalition is composed by one member its value is one
    if(length(comb[[i]]) == 1){
      risultato[i] <- 0
    }else{
      
      #we take the the rows of players that belong to i-th coalition
      member <- matrice[comb[[i]],]
      
      #we compare the columns of the selected rows
      #if two workers work during the same hour the sum of that column will be greater than one
      #we save (the sum of the column - 1)hours
      #we consider hours in which more players work
      #just like in char_function_1 
      vettore <- colSums(member)
      risultato[i] <- sum(vettore[vettore > 1] - 1)
    }
    
   #creation of a temporary list in which the first number is the value of the coalition, while the second is the coalition
   temp <- list(list(risultato[i], comb[[i]]))
   
   #output
   ris <- append(ris, temp)
  }
  #return 
  return(ris)
}

#just to check if our function is right we take the schedule of the homework 
char_funs <- char_function(matrice_prova, n = 12)

#coalition of which we are interested in 
query <- sort(seq(12,1))

#scan all the coalition
for(i in 1:(2^12-1)){
  
  #suppressWarnings needs when we compare coalition of different sizes
  #all elements 
  if(suppressWarnings(all(char_funs[[i]][[2]] == query)==TRUE)){
    
    #its value
    print(char_funs[[i]][[1]])
  }
}

#another example
query <- sort(c(1,2))
for(i in 1:(2^12-1)){
  if(suppressWarnings(all(char_funs[[i]][[2]] == query) ==TRUE)){
    print(char_funs[[i]][[1]])
  }
}

#number of workers
n <- 15

#just build a random matrix that represents the schedule 
matrice <- sapply(x, function(x) sample(c(0,1), size = n, replace = T, prob = c(0.75,0.25)))
char_funs <- char_function(matrice, n)

```

## 3. Statistical

Following the idea of diversification we have collected *n=15* stocks from five different sectors, three for each one.

For each stock we have take the closing price from January 1, 2020 till today. Using the function *get_hist_quote* we have taken the closing price and not the adjusted closing price, but if we downloaded data from *"Yahoo! Finance"* and created a dataset we would not have updated data each time we would want to run the code. 
We have created a list *quotes* in which each element i has *m* closing prices of the i-th stock, *m* is the number of days in which the Stock Market has been opened from January 1, 2020 till today.

Then we have created the data matrix *X* which elements are $x_{t,j} = log(\frac{c_{t,j}}{c_{t-1,j}})$ where t and t-1 are two consecutive days. X has m-1 rows and n columns.


```{r}

suppressMessages(require(tseries, quietly = TRUE)) # Load the package
options("getSymbols.warning4.0" = FALSE) # Stop info-messages to show up


#tag of stocks
company_1 = c("NFLX", "EA", "ATVI", "PSX", "CTRA", "FANG","AAL", "UAL", "LUV", "DPZ", "AMZN", "TSCO", "TAP", "K", "SJM")

datamatrix <- function(company){
  #counter
  c = 0
  #number of stocks
  n = length(company)
  #list in which each element contains all the closing prices for that stock
  quotes <- list(length = n)
  for(i in company){
    c = c + 1
    
    #retrieving the closing price for c-th stock
    quotes[c] <- list(get.hist.quote(instrument=i, start="2020-01-01",
                             quote= "Close", provider="yahoo", drop=TRUE))
    
  }
  #number of days in which Stock Market was open from 2020-01-01 till today
  m <- length(quotes[[1]])
  #data matrix
  X <- matrix(, nrow = m - 1, ncol = n, dimnames = list(1:(m -1), company))
  #rows of data matrix
  r <- c(length = m - 1)
  #for each company
  for(j in 1:n){
    
    #for each pair of days
    for(i in 1:(m-1)){
      
      #computing the logarithm between two closing price between i+1-th and i-th day of company j-th 
      r[i] <- log(as.numeric(quotes[[j]][i+1])/as.numeric(quotes[[j]][i]))
    }
    #fill the data matrix
    X[,j] <- r
  }
  return(X)
}
X <- datamatrix(company_1)
```

From the data matrix X we have built an adjacency matrix through the function *m_adj*: firstly we compute all possible way to take two stocks. Then we compute through the function *cor.test* an asymptotic Normal-based confidence interval for Pearson-correlation for each couple of stocks i and j and to build the adjacency matrix we put 1 in the position [i,j] and [j,i] if the confidence interval does not include zero, 0 otherwise.

The function *m_adj* takes in input, in addition to data matrix, also the coverage $(1-\alpha)$ of the CI because we have wanted to study how the adjacency matrix changes varying the coverage of the CI.

```{r}

m_adj <- function(data, conf){
  #input:
  #data: data matrix
  #conf: alpha for confidence interval

  #output:
  #adj: adjacency matrix

  #all possible way to take two stocks
  couples <- CombSet(ncol(data), 2)

    #number of stocks
  n = length(colnames(data))

  #list of CI for Pearson correlation for each couple of stocks
  corrr <- list()

  #for each couple of stocks
  for(i in 1: nrow(couples)){

    #compute CI for Pearson correlation for i-th couple of stock
    corrr[i] <- list(cor.test(data[,couples[i,1]], data[,couples[i,2]], method = "pearson", conf.level = conf)$conf.int)

After building the adjacency matrix we draw the corresponding graph for each level of alpha that we have chosen. Just looking the graph we have noticed that the more $(1-\alpha)$ is near 1 the less the stocks are connected each other.

To look in depth how and which edges are filtered increasing the value of $\alpha$ we have tried to write some visualization and functions.

Firstly through the function *check* we check if among stocks of the same sector there is always the max number of edges. It has turned out that stocks of the same sector are always linked independently from the level $(1-\alpha)$. So stocks of the same sectors always make a clique! Indeed in each of these graphs there is always a clique of at least size three (number of stocks in a group). This behaviour confirms the hypothesis of the homework's instructions: *"stocks from the same GICS sectors should tend to be clustered together"*.

Then we have plotted a stacked barplot in which for each sector and for each level of $(1- \alpha)$ we visualize through the height of the bars the number of edges between a sector and all the others. In this way we notice clearly that edges between different sectors are filtered increasing the coverage of CI. The minimum height of a bar is nine. From the graphs and barplot we can think that there are sectors that are similar between them. It seems reasonable that stocks coming from Energy and Industrial are linked together as stocks from Consumer Discretionary and Communication services because maybe they are related in the Market.

    if(adj[i,i+1] + adj[i,i+2] + adj[i+1,i+2] == 3){
      c <- c + 3
    }else{
      return("Attention: CI's of stock in the same group include zero")
    }
  }
  if(c == ncol(adj)){
    return("CI's of stock in the same group does never include zero")
  }
}

Reading the pdf documentation of *igraph* we have found also the function *cluster_edge_betweenness* that is helpful for community detection:
*"Many networks consist of modules which are densely connected themselves but sparsely connected to other modules."* This seems exactly our case indeed for $(1-\alpha)$ greater than 0.99 there are two clusters. So using this function we have a confirm that we have two communities in graph with $(1-\alpha)$ = 0.9999:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
gruppi[[5]][1]$'1'
gruppi[[5]][2]$'2'
```

For each level of alpha that we have chosen we have computed the largest cliques in the graph and their size. In the graph with $(1- \alpha)$ the two clusters are two cliques: the first one is the largest clique, that has size = 7, is:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
largest_click[[5]][[1]]
```

While the other one is a clique of size = 6: "

```{r,echo=FALSE}
click[[5]][[2]]
```

These functions sustain the draw of the graphs.

Without Consumer Staples the graph is disconnected in two cluster. Instead for alpha smaller than 0.9 all the stocks are more connected each other an for $(1-\alpha)$ = 0.5 the graph is almost fully connected, indeed the largest clique has size 10 and it is:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
largest_click[[1]][[1]]
```

We visualize through a barplot how the size of the largest clique decreases, increasing the coverage $(1-\alpha)$.

```{r}
f <- c(frecce[1]-frecce[2],frecce[2]-frecce[3],frecce[3]-frecce[4],frecce[4]-frecce[5],frecce[5]-frecce[6])
data <- data.frame(
  alpha=c("0.5;0.3","0.3;0.1","0.1;0.01","0.01;0.001","0.0001;0.000001"),
  size_clique=f
  )
# Barplot
ggplot(data, aes(x=rev(alpha), y=size_clique)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color="blue", fill=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7) )
```


```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  alpha=c("0.5","0.3","0.1","0.01","0.0001","0.000001"),
  filtered_edges = frecce - 15
  )
# Barplot
ggplot(data, aes(x=alpha, y=filtered_edges)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color="red", fill = "lightcoral")
```

After having seen how the number of edges changes with $\alpha$ we want to see if taking the same number of stocks from the same sector we obtain the same kind of graph with two clusters.

```{r}
#new stocks
company_2 = c("GOOGL", "T", "DISCK", "APA", "BKR", "CVX","ALK", "WM", "UNP", "UAA", "TSLA", "SBUX", "PM", "PEP", "KO")

#new data matrix
X_2 <- datamatrix(company_2)

#compute different adjacency matrix for different alpha
adi_7 = m_adj(X_2, 0.5)
adi_8 = m_adj(X_2, 0.7)
adi_9 = m_adj(X_2, 0.9)
adi_10 = m_adj(X_2, 0.99)
adi_11 = m_adj(X_2, 0.9999)
adi_12 = m_adj(X_2, 0.999999)

t <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adi_7, mode = "undirected")
paste("The largest clique in the graph with (1 - alpha) = 0.5 has a size of ", clique_num(t))

t <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adi_12, mode = "undirected")
paste("The largest clique in the graph with (1 - alpha) = 0.9999 has a size of ", clique_num(t))


#just to visualize contemporarely more graph
gridExtra::grid.arrange(visualize(adi_7) + ggtitle("alpha = 0.5"), visualize(adi_12) +ggtitle("alpha = 0.999999"), nrow = 2)
```

We obtain a pretty different results indeed we obtained a graph that is fully connected for $(1 - \alpha) = 0.5$, while in the one with $\alpha$ = 0.999999 just few edges are filtered. So the influence of $\alpha$ is really restrained respect to the stocks that we have chosen initially.

So we cannot generalize telling for example that stocks from Energy sector are linked to stocks from Industrials, while they are not connected to stocks from Communication services. It seems that the choice of single stocks is crucial. Now we have been curious to see what happens if we chose still three stocks but from the other five sectors.

```{r}
company_3 <- c("WFC", "NDAQ", "JPM", "PFE", "CTLT", "JNJ", "EIX", "ATO", "AWK", "ACN", "PYPL", "ORCL", "APD", "IP", "IFF")

#new data matrix
X_3 <- datamatrix(company_3)

adi_14 <- m_adj(X_3, 0.9999)

#from adjacency matrix to graph
grafo_14 <- network(adi_14)

t <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adi_14, mode = "undirected")


paste("The largest clique has a size of ", clique_num(t))


#attribute of the vertex
#important for the legend of vertexes'color
grafo_14 %v% "GICS" <- c(rep("Financials",3),rep("Health Care",3),rep("Utilities",3),rep("IT",3),rep("Materials",3))

#plot of the graph
grafo_14 <- ggnet2(grafo_14, color = "GICS", palette = c("Financials" = "purple", "Health Care" = "steelblue", "Utilities" = "gray", "IT"="salmon", "Materials" = "green"),label = colnames(adi_14), label.size = 2,label.color = "black", edge.size = 0.3, node.size = 7)
grafo_14

```

Also with the other five sectors we obtained a graph that is almost fully connected for each level $\alpha$ so we can conclude that it is true that stocks from the same GICS sectors are clustered together, but they interact a lot, almost in the same way, also with stocks of other sectors. Just in the first portfolio we have seen a strong separation between stocks of different sectors, but this is due to the singular stocks that we have chosen because with other stocks of the same sectors this separation does not exist anymore. While in the other cases all the stocks seem related each other. We have thought that this behaviour could be due to Covid-19, that is a phenomenon that has damaged all the sectors indiscriminately and so in this way it could have linked all together. Maybe just few companies differentiate from the others.
